# NUS Better Next Bus

**WIP**

## Developing

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```
